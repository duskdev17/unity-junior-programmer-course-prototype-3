This is a simple mini game made in Unity similar to the 2d "Dinosaur Game" that most of us have played at least once on chrome browser. If he collides with an obstacle, then the game is over. This game is almost almost the same as that game but it's 2d and it does have some colorful graphics and animations. Player has to jump to avoid obstacles. A lot other functionality can be added later.

note: the project is not finished yet.
